Demo: https://cocoabutter.herokuapp.com

## Motivation

An easy way to collect and view crash reports from real users with Sketch related details such as the current page artboards and exception message.

## Integration

1. Drop [CocoaButter.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnimaApp/CocoaButter/master/CocoaButter.js) in your Plugin folder.
2. ```@import 'CocoaButter.js'``` into your `.cocoascript` files.
3. Wrap your plugin code with `try` `catch`
4. Initialize `CocoaButter` instance and `report()`
```
@import 'CocoaButter.js'

var onRun = function(context) {
  try {
    ...<your plugin code>...
  }
  catch (e) {
    var cocoabutter = new CocoaButter()
    cocoabutter.baseURL = "<your cocoabutter server url (i.e http://cocoabutter.herokuapp.com)"
    cocoabutter.username = "<your cocoabutter username>"
    cocoabutter.password = "<your cocoabutter password>"
    cocoabutter.report(e, context)
  }
}
```
